- 👋 Hi, I’m @Peelington

Hello there! My name is Peeliongton, and I'm a recent graduate of VSchool, specializing in JavaScript and React development. With a passion for crafting seamless user experiences and a strong foundation in modern web technologies, I'm eager to dive into the world of software engineering.

Throughout my journey through VSchool, I've honed my skills in front-end development, leveraging the power of JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive web applications. React has become my go-to framework for building scalable, modular, and responsive user interfaces.

Driven by a curiosity for learning and a dedication to staying updated with industry trends, I'm excited to apply my knowledge and creativity to real-world projects. Whether it's collaborating with a team or independently tackling challenges, I thrive in environments that encourage innovation and growth.
